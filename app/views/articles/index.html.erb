<p class="subtitle" style="max-width: 890px;">
Our workshops are focused on helping our students gain a deeper knowledge of their bodies; enabling them to improve their movements in and outside the classroom space. We touch on themes that we may not be able to cover during a normal weekly class and deepen both the experience and knowledge of the movement modality being covered during the workshop
